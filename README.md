# The-ADI-Method-for-the-algebraic-Riccati-equation
The program is written in C++ and solves the algebraic Riccati equation with a singular matrix E using the ADI method. Equation is taken from Shafiee's article «Optimal control for a class of singular systems using neural network». The necessary matrices are fed to the input, and the user receives a solution to the equation at the output.
The full technical problem, the algorithm and its flowchart, as well as the testing of the program are in aisd5.pdf. A detailed description of the algorithm can be found in Riccati_algorithm.pdf.
